## Cloud Native Software Engineering

This repository will be used for in class demonstrations and to provide students with scaffolded code for my cloud native software engineering class.

Contents:

1. [Go Tutorial](./gotutorial/).  This directory contains a basic go language tutorial to get you ready for this class
2. [ToDo Application](./todo/).  This directory contains the assignment for building a simple `todo` app.  It has a significant amount of scaffolded code, and is a good initial example in building CLI-based applications in Go.

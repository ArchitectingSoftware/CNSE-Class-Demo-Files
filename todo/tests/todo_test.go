package tests

//Introduction to testing.  Note that testing is built into go and we will be using
//it extensively in this class. Below is a starter for your testing code.  In
//addition to what is built into go, we will be using a few third party packages
//that improve the testing experience.  The first is testify.  This package brings
//asserts to the table, that is much better than directly interacting with the
//testing.T object.  Second is gofakeit.  This package provides a significant number
//of helper functions to generate random data to make testing easier.

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"

// Note the default file path is relative to the test package location.  The
// project has a /tests path where you are at and a /data path where the
// database file sits.  So to get there we need to back up a directory and
// then go into the /data directory.  Thus this is why we are setting the
// default file name to "../data/todo.json"
const (
	DEFAULT_DB_FILE_NAME = "../data/todo.json"

// note init() is a helpful function in golang.  If it exists in a package
// such as we are doing here with the testing package, it will be called
// exactly once.  This is a great place to do setup work for your tests.

	//all of our testing functions to make life easier

	//at things like assert.Equal() and assert.Condition()

	//and making sure it matches the item that you put in the DB above

// TODO: Please delete this test from your submission, it does not do anything
// but i wanted to demonstrate how you can starting shelling out your tests
// and then implment them later.  The go testing framework provides a
// Skip() function that just tells the testing framework to skip or ignore
// this test function
func TestAddPlaceholderTest(t *testing.T) {
	t.Skip("Placeholder test not implemented yet")

//TODO: Create additional tests to showcase the correct operation of your program
//for example getting an item, getting all items, updating items, and so on. Be
//creative here.

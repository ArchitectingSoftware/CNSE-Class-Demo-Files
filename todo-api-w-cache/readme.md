## ToDo API Demo - With Cache

This is an extension of the todo API that persists todo data in a Redis cache.  Objectives:

1. Extend our reference API to integrate with a popular cloud-native cache called redis.
2. Gain experience using a service, redis in this case, that is packaged and deployed in a docker container.

Installing Redis GoLang Client `go get github.com/redis/go-redis/v8`
Installing Redis JSON Extension for GoLang `go get github.com/nitishm/go-rejson/v4`

**IMPORTANT:  REDIS MUST BE RUNNING AND AVAILABLE ON ITS STANDARD PORT 6973 FOR THIS API TO WORK PROPERLY.  DIRECTIONS FOR HOW TO INSTALL AND RUN REDIS LOCALLY VIA A CONTAINER ARE AVAILABLE VIA THE [cache](./cache) DIRECTORY**

### Why use the gin framework?

Many people in the golang community are opposed to using frameworks because the standard library provides robust function out-of-the-box.  However, the golang gin framework reduces a lot of the code you need to write and has a lot of nice features out of the box.  As far as I know its still the most popular and widely used API framework for go.

Online documentation for gin can be found here:
